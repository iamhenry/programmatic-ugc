# Zero Proof Content Style Guide

Style reference for AI-generated Instagram carousel content about sobriety and alcohol recovery for the Zero Proof iOS App.

---

## 1. Voice & Tone

| Principle | Do | Don't |
|-----------|----|----|
| **Direct** | "Your liver begins healing within 48 hours" | "It's possible that liver function may improve" |
| **Empathetic** | "Recovery isn't linear—setbacks happen" | "If you fail, try again" |
| **Science-informed** | "Cortisol (your stress hormone) drops" | "Cortisol levels decrease" without context |
| **Accessible** | "GABA—your brain's natural calm signal" | "GABAergic neurotransmission normalizes" |
| **Positive framing** | "Your sleep deepens by week 2" | "You won't have terrible sleep forever" |
| **Progress-oriented** | "By day 7, your liver enzymes begin to normalize" | "Your liver will get better eventually" |
| **Concrete** | "48 hours", "2 weeks", "30 days" | "over time", "eventually", "soon" |

**POV:** Second person ("you", "your body", "your brain")

**Avoid:**
- Shame language
- Absolutes ("always", "never")
- Unsourced claims
- Medical advice
- Celebration hype ("Amazing!", "Incredible!", "You've got this!")
- Prescriptive commands ("You should", "You need to")
- Vague timeframes ("eventually", "over time", "soon")

## 2. Cover Slide Patterns

### Headline Formats

**Question format:**
```
What happens to [body part] when you [quit drinking / stop alcohol / get sober]?
```
Examples:
- "What happens to your brain when you quit drinking?"
- "What happens to your gut when you stop alcohol?"

**Statement format:**
```
How [topic] changes in [timeframe / sobriety]
```
Examples:
- "How your sleep changes in the first month sober"
- "How anxiety shifts after quitting alcohol"

### Highlight Word
The last word or phrase of the headline—designed to grab attention.

| Good highlights | Weak highlights |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "...quit **alcohol**" | "...quit **it**" |
| "...your **anxiety**" | "...your **feelings**" |
| "...deep **sleep**" | "...better **rest**" |

Pick concrete, emotionally resonant nouns.

### Subtitle
Single sentence answering "why should I care?"

```
[Timeframe] + [specific benefit or change]
```
Examples:
- "The science of how your body repairs itself week by week"
- "Why the first 2 weeks feel hard—and when it gets easier"

## 3. Content Slide Patterns

### Title Progressions

Choose ONE progression per carousel:

**Timeline progression:**
1. The Problem (with alcohol)
2. Early Recovery (1-4 weeks)
3. Mid Recovery (1-3 months)
4. Long-term (3+ months)

**Cause/Effect progression:**
1. What happens
2. Why it happens
3. How it heals

**Before/During/After progression:**
1. With alcohol
2. During withdrawal
3. In sobriety

### Bullet Style

**Structure:** `[Noun/Verb phrase] → [concrete outcome]`

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| "Cortisol spikes → racing thoughts at 3am" | "You will feel anxious at night" |
| "REM sleep returns → vivid dreams increase" | "Your dreams might become more vivid" |
| "Gut lining heals → nutrient absorption improves" | "Your gut gets healthier over time" |

**Rules:**
- Start with noun or verb (not "You will...")
- Include physiological mechanism when possible
- Cause → effect structure
- 10-15 words per bullet
- 3-4 bullets per slide

---

## 4. End Slide (CTA) Pattern

### Structure

```
Line 1: Save this if you're [situation related to topic]
Line 2: Share with someone who [relatable struggle]
Line 3: [Encouraging closer]
```

### Examples

**Sleep topic:**
```
Save this if you're struggling to sleep without alcohol
Share with someone who thinks they need a drink to rest
Your body remembers how to sleep—give it time
```

**Anxiety topic:**
```
Save this if you're white-knuckling through sober anxiety
Share with someone who drinks to quiet their mind
The calm you're chasing is already inside you
```

### Highlight Phrase
Topic hook for the CTA slide—captures the carousel theme.

Examples: "sober sleep", "gut healing", "mental clarity", "real energy"

### Closer Guidelines
- Quiet confidence—state facts, don't cheerlead
- No exclamation marks
- No commands ("You should...")
- Acknowledge the journey without overpromising
- 30-60 characters

## 5. Character Limits

| Element | Min | Max | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----|-------|
| Cover headline | 30 | 65 | Must end with highlight word |
| Highlight word | 5 | 15 | Concrete noun preferred |
| Subtitle | 40 | 80 | Single sentence |
| Content title | 20 | 45 | Matches progression step |
| Bullet item | 30 | 70 | Cause → effect format |
| Bullets per slide | 3 | 4 | Never 2, never 5+ |
| CTA save line | 40 | 80 | "Save this if..." |
| CTA share line | 40 | 80 | "Share with someone who..." |
| CTA closer | 30 | 60 | Encouraging, not preachy |
| CTA highlight phrase | 10 | 30 | Topic hook |

## 6. Timeframe Heuristics

Guidance for research-backed timeline content. Do NOT hardcode specific timeframes—let research inform the numbers.

### Principles

1. **Anchor to specific markers, not ranges**
   - ✅ "By day 3" / "At 2 weeks" / "Around month 2"
   - ❌ "Within the first few weeks" / "Over time"

2. **Lead with earliest noticeable change**
   - Prioritize when users will *feel* something, not clinical endpoints
   - Example: "Sleep quality dips before it improves" > "Sleep normalizes by month 3"

3. **Use body system as organizing principle**
   - Group facts by organ/system (liver, gut, brain, skin)
   - This naturally creates timeline progression

4. **Trust research over assumptions**
   - If web search returns different timeframes than expected, use research
   - Flag conflicting sources rather than averaging

5. **Qualify uncertainty when appropriate**
   - "For most people, by week 2..."
   - "Research suggests around day 10..."
   - Avoid false precision on individual variation

### Research Focus Areas

When researching a topic, look for:
- **Earliest measurable change** (not just "improvement")
- **Mechanism** (what's actually happening physiologically)
- **Variability factors** (drinking history, age, etc.)
- **Subjective vs objective** (when you *feel* it vs when tests show it)

## 7. Example Topics

### Validated Topics

| Topic | Cover angle | Key mechanism |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Sleep recovery | "What happens to your sleep when you quit alcohol?" | REM rebound, melatonin regulation |
| Anxiety & gut-brain | "Why quitting alcohol reduces anxiety" | GABA regulation, vagus nerve, gut microbiome |
| Liver healing | "How your liver heals after you stop drinking" | Enzyme normalization, fat reduction, regeneration |
| Energy levels | "Why you're tired in early sobriety—and when energy returns" | Mitochondrial repair, blood sugar stabilization |
| Skin changes | "What happens to your skin when you quit alcohol" | Hydration, inflammation reduction, collagen |
| Memory & focus | "How sobriety improves your memory" | Hippocampal recovery, prefrontal function |

### Topic Expansion Pattern

For each topic, identify:
1. **The hook:** Why someone would stop scrolling
2. **The mechanism:** The science that explains it
3. **The timeline:** When they'll notice changes
4. **The payoff:** The benefit they'll experience

## 8. AI Prompt Integration

When generating content, include these constraints:

```
VOICE: Direct, empathetic, science-informed, accessible
POV: Second person (you/your)
FRAMING: Positive (healing/benefits, not shame)
JARGON: Explain any medical terms in parentheses
BULLETS: Start with noun/verb, cause→effect, 10-15 words
LIMITS: [reference table above]
```

- [ ] Title progression is consistent across slides
- [ ] All bullets start with noun/verb (not "You will")
- [ ] CTA includes save, share, and closer lines
