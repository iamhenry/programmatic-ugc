# Create Issue Command

Creates detailed task templates using comprehensive templates designed for delegating work to junior developers. Creates local files in `_ai/task/`.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

**BEFORE PROCEEDING - VERIFY:**

- [ ] ALL 15+ template sections included (no exceptions)
- [ ] Local file created in `_ai/task/` directory

## Usage

/create-issue [task-title] [task-description]

### Auto-Generation

- When no arguments provided: auto-generates title and description using natural language based on current context
- Uses git status, recent commits, and general project state for smart defaults

### My Manual Inputs

- adr.md (ex. `_ai/task/2025-11-26-m6-fuzzy-matching/adr.md`)

---

## Implementation

You are a task template creator that takes user input and creates comprehensive, well-structured templates as GitHub issues and/or local files.

### Input Processing

The task details are provided as: $ARGUMENTS

Parse the arguments to extract:

1. Task title (first argument or auto-generate if empty)
2. Task description and context (remaining arguments or auto-generate if empty)

### Auto-Generation Logic

When no title/description provided:

1. Analyze current context (git status, recent commits, branch name)
2. Generate a practical task title and description using natural language
3. Focus on immediate development needs and current work
4. Default to generic development task if context is minimal

---

### Task Template

Create tasks using this comprehensive template (used for both GitHub issues and local files):

````markdown
## [PARSED TASK TITLE]

<!--
- THIS IS YOUR SOURCE OF TRUTH.
- USE IT TO TAKE ANY NOTES YOU MAY FIND HELPFUL.
- AS YOU COMPLETE THE TASK, UPDATE THIS CHECKLIST TO REFLECT PROGRESS. (- [x] for done, - [ ] for pending)
-->

### Executive Summary

### 🧩 Implementation Checklist (Step-by-Step To-Do)

#### Phase 1: Implementation Tasks

<!-- A detailed and thorough decomposed checklist (with tasks and subtasks) that's broken up into logical phases/milestones for a junior developer to accomplish this task. -->

**FORMAT GUIDE** (Use this structure for first phase, then repeat pattern for subsequent phases):

**Phase N: [Descriptive Phase Name] ([Time Estimate])**

**Task N.X: [Clear Task Objective]**

- [ ] ACTION: [Description of task] [specific file/location]
- [ ] ACTION: [Description] [what is being added/changed]
- [ ] ACTION: [Implementation step with technical detail]
  - [ ] SUBTASK: [Nested substep if needed]
- [ ] NOTE: [Reference similar patterns, file locations, line numbers if helpful]

**ACTION PREFIXES:**
Start every checklist item with an **ALL CAPS** Action Verb followed by a colon. This makes the step immediately actionable.

*Suggested prefixes (use these or similar specific verbs):*

- CREATE: / ADD: (New files/features)
- UPDATE: / MODIFY: (Existing code)
- IMPLEMENT: (Core logic)
- RESEARCH: / ANALYZE: (Investigation tasks)
- REFACTOR: (Cleanup)
- VERIFY: / TEST: (Validation steps)
- CONFIG: (Settings/Env)

**CODE SNIPPET GUIDELINES:**

- Include code snippets for complex implementations or non-obvious patterns
- Reference existing code: "Mirror pattern from `file.ts:line-number`" or copy small snippets
- Provide inline code examples for new functions, types, or configurations
- Use markdown code blocks with language syntax highlighting (e.g., `tsx, `ts, ```bash)
- Show before/after code for modifications to existing files
- Keep snippets concise and focused on the specific task

**STYLE RULES:**

- **Use Action Prefixes**: Ensure checklist items start with an ALL CAPS verb (e.g., CREATE:, RESEARCH:).
- Include file paths in backticks: `path/to/file.ts`
- Reference code patterns: "Clone X from `file.ts:20-65`" or "Mirror pattern in `file.ts`"
- Nest substeps when task has multiple parts (use 2-space indentation)
- Add "Implementation notes:" as last item to guide junior developers to examples
- Keep tasks atomic: one clear outcome per task

**REPEAT THIS STRUCTURE** for each subsequent phase/milestone.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Focus ONLY on code implementation - NO test creation unless explicitly requested
- Each task should specify the files to create/modify
- Break down into atomic tasks following the guidelines above

---

[Generate the actual implementation checklist following the format above]

#### Phase 2: Quality Gates

Once implementation is complete, verify code quality by running these checks in order:

- [ ] **Type Safety**: Run type checking to verify no type errors exist
- [ ] **Code Linting**: Run linting to ensure code follows project standards
- [ ] **Build Verification**: Run build process to confirm no compilation errors
- [ ] **Regression Testing**: Run existing test suite to ensure no functionality broke (DO NOT create new tests unless explicitly requested)

**NOTE**: These quality gates are SEPARATE from implementation. Run them AFTER completing all implementation tasks. Use the project's configured commands (check package.json scripts or project documentation for specific commands).

---

### Manual QA Checklist

[A minimal checklist of manual test cases to verify functionality after implementation.]

```

## Atomic Task Requirements

(for reference only, not to be included in the final document)

**Each task must meet these criteria for optimal agent execution:**

- **File Scope**: Touches 1-4 related files maximum
- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
- **Specific Files**: Specify files to create/modify
- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching

## Task Format Guidelines

(for reference only, not to be included in the final document)

- Use checkbox format: `- [ ] Task number. Task description`
- **Use subtasks**: Group related work under parent tasks (e.g., 4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3)
- **Specify implementation details** as bullet points under each subtask
- **Avoid broad terms**: No "system", "integration", "complete" in task titles
- **DO NOT include test creation** in implementation tasks unless explicitly requested in the task description
- **Quality gates** (typecheck, lint, build, test) should be listed SEPARATELY in Phase 2 after implementation tasks
- Distinguish between "writing code" and "running validation commands"

## Good vs Bad Task Examples

(for reference only, not to be included in the final document)

❌ **Bad Examples (Too Broad)**:

- "Implement authentication system" (affects too many files, multiple purposes)
- "Add user management features" (vague scope, no files specification)
- "Build complete dashboard" (too large, multiple components)

✅ **Good Examples (Atomic with Subtasks)**:

- 4. Develop API endpoints and routing
  - 4.1 Set up routing configuration and middleware
  - 4.2 IMPLEMENT: Add CRUD API endpoints
  - 4.3 UPDATE: Add API documentation
  - 4.4 RESEARCH: Compare library X vs Y for validation

---

### Local File Creation

When creating local files:

1. Generate slug from task title:
   - Extract 3-5 key words from parsed task title
   - Convert to lowercase, replace spaces/special chars with dashes
   - Remove articles (a, an, the) and filler words (for, with, using)
   - Example: "Implement Spotify Preflight Token Validation" → `spotify-preflight-validation`
2. Create timestamp using `date +%Y-%m-%d`
3. Create directory: `_ai/task/{TIMESTAMP}-{SLUG}/`
4. Write file as: `plan.md`
5. Full path: `_ai/task/{TIMESTAMP}-{SLUG}/plan.md`

Example: `_ai/task/2025-11-20-spotify-preflight-validation/plan.md`

---

### Error Handling

**For Local Files:**

- Check write permissions for `_ai/task/` directory
- Handle directory creation if it doesn't exist
- Provide clear feedback on file location

### Implementation Steps

1. **Parse Arguments**: Extract content, auto-generate if needed
2. **Generate Content**: Create comprehensive task template using parsed/generated data
3. **Create Local File**: Write to `_ai/task/{TIMESTAMP}-{SLUG}/plan.md`
4. **Report Results**: Provide clear feedback on file location

Start by processing $ARGUMENTS, auto-generating content if needed, and creating the local file.
