What kind of questions would people going into sobriety be asking? 
These are the kind of topics that I want to cover, as educational content for Instagram. 

## Topic Ideas/Questions
Mental model: **uncertainty → anxiety → relapse risk**.
Your content reduces uncertainty.

## Questions people actually ask entering sobriety

###  Body and symptoms
- [ ] Is this anxiety normal or am I broken
- [ ] Why do I feel worse after I quit
- [ ] How long until I feel normal again
- [ ] Why is my gut messed up now
- [ ] Is brain fog part of quitting alcohol
- [ ] Why is my sleep so bad at first
- [ ] Why am I so tired even though I stopped drinking
- [ ] Are these mood swings permanent
- [ ] Why do I feel numb or flat
- [ ] When does energy come back

### Cravings and urges
- [ ] Why do cravings come in waves
- [ ] Why are urges worse at night
- [ ] Why does boredom feel unbearable
- [ ] Does wanting a drink mean I am failing
- [ ] Why do cravings spike after a few weeks

### Timeline and expectations

### Mental health and identity

### Fear and reassurance

### Social and daily life
- [ ] How do I handle social events now
- [ ] What do I say when people ask why I am not drinking

### Why this works for Instagram
Each question = one carousel.
Hook = the question.
Slides = biology timeline + reassurance.
Save share driven.
