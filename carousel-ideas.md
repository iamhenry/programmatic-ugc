What kind of questions would people going into sobriety be asking? 
These are the kind of topics that I want to cover, as educational content for Instagram. 

# Topic Ideas
Mental model: **uncertainty → anxiety → relapse risk**.
Your content reduces uncertainty.

**Why this works for Instagram**
Each question = one carousel.
Hook = the question.
Slides = biology timeline + reassurance.
Save share driven.
